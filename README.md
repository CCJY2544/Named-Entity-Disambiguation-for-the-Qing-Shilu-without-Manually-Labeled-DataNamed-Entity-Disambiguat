# Abstract

The study of historical figures is of great significance in the field of history. To investigate historical figures with digital humanity methods, the first step is to identify the names of people in texts. Not only is the person's name recognized from the text, but the person's name has to be linked to a knowledge base for reference. This is because the same person's name may refer to different people or other entities. This task is called named entity disambiguation (NED). The problem ofhistorical figures with the same name is particularly serious when studying Manchu and Mongolian historical figures in the Qing Dynasty. A typical example is that the main persons (Cherin-Dorji, Yung-Te, Siang-Lin and Gui-Xiang) involved in the disaster report of the Kharkha Four Leagues (Ting- ting, 2016)have the same name as other historical figures. Fig. 1 shows that there are 10 Siang-Lins in the Ming-Qing Archives Name Authority Database (MQANAD).Our multi-stepped procedure can count total number of registered persons in given locations to a very high level of accuracy. The Ottoman population registers claims to cover entire male populace in the places they were conducted. The scribes did not reliably count the registered persons. Just to be able to automatically count total numbers of registered persons has huge potential for historical population studies using Ottoman archival documentation. Furthermore, we can now also count total number of households automatically. This feature has exploratory value for assessing household sizes for large parts of the mid-nineteenth century Ottoman Empire.
